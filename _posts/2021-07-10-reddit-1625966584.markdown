title: I want to thank the Ethereum community for getting me back into what I love. I used to code but eventually lost interest and my work shifted into sales. Ethereum has ignited my coding passion again. Im currently studying Solidity. I’m getting back into Python. May take a course for C+ & Java. 🙏🏻
