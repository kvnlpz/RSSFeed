title: Got stuck in trading halt on NURO today. I was short 60 shares with an average around $17. Stock massively ran at open and got stuck in the first halt, and got out when it finally ended at around $22. I lost $450 on the trade, but at one stage during the halt my p&l was down -30,000k!!!! WTF!?
