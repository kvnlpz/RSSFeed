title: WYZth is a TRC-20 token made by one of my acquaintance. It is a utility token which can be used for day to day shopping as well as for various DeFi services. If legit, this looks like a brilliant opportunity. I want some expert opinion about this project. Is it legit? If not, what are the red flags?
