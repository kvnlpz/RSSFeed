title: FULL AUTISTIC RETARDED DUMMY. I THOUGHT I HAD IT FIGURED OUT AT THE START OF THE YEAR. MY FIRST TIME DIPPING MY TOES INTO OPTIONS TRADING. STARTED WITH $1000 IN DEC. 2020. not sure why i have a negative balance before i ever started actually trading but it's been like that since the big spike.
