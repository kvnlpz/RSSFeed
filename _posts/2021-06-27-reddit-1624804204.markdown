title: Ape Psychology 🦧🍿🌑 - I'm supposed to hate Robinhood, but on January 27th when they wouldn't let me sell my AMC shares at $20, $19, $18, $17, $16 or even $15, I went all ape shit and am still holding today (purchased at $2.01/share). Plus, lets give it to them, their new debit cards are bananas!
