title: Chart Analysis-following yesterdayâ€™s news on moneygram time to have a look at the technicals. Â£0.15/$0.20 level held looking like a double bottom. Recent trendline being tested need a break above. ADX showing slowing momentum on the downside. So still early days but good signs for a move up.ðŸš€ðŸš€
