title: I've been seeing a lot of this dumb F'ing posts going around and people on Twitter suaing they are selling ataround $500, $1000, $2000 and so on. This is pathetic FUD at best. We all know what the floor is and it keeps going up! Stop being papperhand b#tch's. My floor is $38 million, but you do you!
