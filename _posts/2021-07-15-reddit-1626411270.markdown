title: At market open I started playing Scatman ski-ba-bop-ba-dop-bop. I shit you not, the louder I played this song the better my options started to look. By eod I was playing this so loud that pieces of my popcorn ceiling were breaking up and falling all over me and my room. AMC vs Scanman connection?
