title: Sold position in ARNC to buy APPL. Bought 500 shares, avg basis $127.60. While the stock ⬇️↔️ initially, it is lately seeing decent gains.⬆️16% so far. Not soaring like AMC or GME, but better than bond yield or CDs.lol. Will hold for the long term and see where it goes.🤘🏼Or, pivot elsewhere?
