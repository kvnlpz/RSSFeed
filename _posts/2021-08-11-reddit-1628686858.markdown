title: Tried to transfer ADA to Daedalus from Coinbase but it said i had to verify my ID for security purposes or wait til the 14th for it to go through. i had already submitted my ID before so i dont know why it asked. I just reuploaded my id to speed up the transfer but it still says to verify id.
