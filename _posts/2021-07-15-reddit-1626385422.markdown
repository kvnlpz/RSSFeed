title: Tripled down on MMAT today. Shorts went to work, but I did what my fellow autists know best. 0 debt and 160 million in the bank. Stock was over 20 bucks a month ago. Like with AMC when I was grabbing shares at 10, Iâ€™ll be ready when the shorts get their hands stuck in the cookie jar once again. ðŸ˜˜
