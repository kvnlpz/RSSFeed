title: Loss porn: I'm one of the idiots who bought $STHC close to the top and rode it all of the way down (-93% on $1200). Holding indefinitely in hopes I can eventually recover a little more money. I had plenty of time to recover more money, so this will be burned into memory. At least I didn't buy more.
