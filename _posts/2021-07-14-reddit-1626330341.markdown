title: I found a bookmarked link I called B-DEX to an explorer.binance.org address balance. It is holding the amount of BNB that I thought I owned. I store most all my stuff using my ledger. I remember binance advertising their DEX. Seems like somewhere I would stash my coins. How did put it there?
